# wordle-cheater
Personal project to help me cheat at wordle 

You will need to run generateAll5LetterWords.py first to get the list of all 5 letter words.

Then, fill in the green_letters, yellow_letters, and grey_letters lists with the values you have on wordle. Run the cheat.py script and it will output the possible words to win that round of wordle! 

Future enhancements: Allowing user to upload wordle screenshot and automatically filling in the green, yellow, and grey lists with values from screenshot. Still working out the bugs with that.
